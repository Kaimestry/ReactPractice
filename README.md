# Frontend Practice Project

## 📌 Overview
This is a **React-based practice project** created to help me improve my frontend development skills and practice **mindful frontend architecture**.

Along the way, I also plan to introduce **basic backend features** to make the project more realistic and closer to a production-ready application.

The project is intentionally structured as a **long-term learning playground** rather than a finished product.

## ✨ Features
The website currently includes a basic interface for:

- 📊 **Dashboard** – overview-style layout  
- 📈 **Statistic Reports** – placeholder for data visualization  
- 👤 **Profile Management** – user-related UI  
- 🤖 **Chatbot Panel** – interactive AI chat interface  

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> This project is still under active development, so not all listed features are fully functional yet.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React**
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## 📚 Challenges & Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I progressed from having **little to no experience with React and TypeScript** to becoming significantly more comfortable with:

- Building **dynamic, component-based UIs**
- Understanding and using the **React ecosystem**
- Designing **scalable UI structures**
- Applying **UI config-driven design** principles
- Using **basic OOP concepts** in frontend development
- Writing **cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable code**

This project helped me think more deliberately about **architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability**, rather than just making things “work”.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add simple backend functionality
- Improve feature completeness
- Deploy the project publicly
- Continue refining architecture and code quality
