# Frontend Practice Project

<h3> 📌 Overview </h3>
This is a React-based practice project created to help me improve my frontend development skills and practice mindful frontend architecture.
Along the way, I also plan to introduce basic backend features to make the project more realistic and closer to a production-ready application.
The project is intentionally structured as a long-term learning playground rather than a finished product.

<h3> ✨ Features </h3>
The website currently includes a basic interface for:
📊 Dashboard – overview-style layout
📈 Statistic Reports – placeholder for data visualization
👤 Profile Management – user-related UI
🤖 Chatbot Panel – interactive AI chat interface

⚠️ Note: This project is still under active development, so not all listed features are fully functional yet.

<h3> 🛠️ Technologies Used </h3>
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

<h3> 📚 Challenges & Learning Outcomes </h3>
Through this project, I progressed from having little to no experience with React and TypeScript to becoming significantly more comfortable with:
- Building dynamic and component-based UIs
- Understanding and using React ecosystem libraries
- Designing scalable UI structures
- Applying UI config-driven design principles
- Using basic OOP concepts in frontend development
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable code
This project has helped me think more deliberately about architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability, rather than just making things “work”.

<h3> 🚀 Future Plans </h3>
- Add simple backend functionality
- Improve feature completeness
- Deploy the project publicly
- Continue refining architecture and code quality
